# Tidewater-CTF

This was my second CTF. I entered in solo and it was much smaller. Only 16 teams. Another person from Cybervets.org enter as well. He is in the Cohort ahead of me. He finished 8th and I finished 9th. This exposed a my weakness in Web Exploitation. So I plan to work on that and be stronger for the next CTF.
